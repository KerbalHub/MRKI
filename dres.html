                    <p>Dres is the inner and smaller of the two dwarf planets. It has a thin ring system, which may have been the result of two previous natural satellites colliding.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Dres has a radius of 108 km (2.5x scale) and a surface gravity of 0.05 g.

                    <br>
                    The dwarf planet has been subject to conspiracy theories and denials ever since its discovery.
