                    <p>Duna is the fourth planet from Kerbol. It has one known natural satellite, Ike, which has the highest mass relative to its parent planet. Duna and Ike are tidally locked to each other.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Duna has a radius of 850 km (2.5x scale) and a surface gravity 38% of Kerbin. Synchronous orbit, while possible, is highly discouraged due to the location of Ike and instead relays should be placed around Ike or in Tundra orbits.

                    <br>
                    Duna is known for its red color. An explanation is pending for how it gained that color.
