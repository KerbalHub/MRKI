                    <p>Eeloo is the farther and larger of the two dwarf planets. It is locked in a 2:3 orbital resonance with Jool, and unlike Dres, lacks known companions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eeloo has a radius of 297 km (2.5x scale) and a surface gravity of 0.083 g.

                    <br>
                    It is likely that a natural satellite will be discovered around Eeloo in the near future, as the dwarf planet is so far away that it is almost to determine whether or not the dark spots on its surface are actually on the surface or a natural satellite.
