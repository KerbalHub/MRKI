                    <p>Eve is a metal-rich terrestrial planet, the second and hottest planet from Kerbol. It is known for its purple cloud cover, which prevents observations of its surface. Its atmosphere is a crushing five times the surface pressure found on Kerbin. Eve's only natural satellite, Gilly, is a likely captured asteroid.

                    Eve is approximately 1.08 times the size of Kerbin (1730 km in 2.5x scale), with 60% more gravity.

                    Observations of Eve have indicated oceans of an unknown substance.
