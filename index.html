                    <p>MRKI (pronounced "murky") is a mod for Kerbal Space Program that aims to completely revamp the Kerbol system with new textures and visuals, mainly powered by Kopernicus, Environmental Visual Enhancements, and Parallax Continued. MRKI is natively scaled at 2.5x stock scale (with 1x and 10x stock scale support with SigmaDimensions) to provide balance to stock parts.

                    The name MRKI has dual meaning, from the Greek word μεράκι, which roughly translates to "passion project", and the acronym "More Realistic, Kerbalized, Interesting" which are the four pillars of MRKI.

                    MRKI is compatible with several interstellar system mods, such as Cosmic Serenity, Kcalbeloh System, and Promised Worlds. Compatibility with other mods is planned.
