                    <p>Moho is the smallest and closest planet to Kerbol and the only one without a significant atmosphere or natural satellites. It has a radius of 627 km (2.5x scale) and a surface gravity 27% of Kerbin's. From space, Moho has a brownish appearance pockmarked with craters due to its almost non-existent atmosphere.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Moho is also the only planet where a synchronous orbit is impossible, due to it being locked in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance with Kerbol.
